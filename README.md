Periodic Green's function MATLAB code
=====================================

Overview
--------

A collection of MATLAB files to pre-compute series terms for the evaluation of periodic Green's function and its gradient.
The Green's function is for Helmholtz operator in 3D domain with periodicity in 2 dimensions (z=constant plane).

The resulting data is used by the Fortran project
